========================
steps to add key:

ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"

$ eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"

ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
========================
Steps to initialize: 

git init
git add .
git commit -m "first commit" 
git remote add origin https://github.com/Akshay-ST/Spark-Notebooks.git

(our local branch is Master, we need to modify it to be same as remote branch which is main)
git branch -M main

git push -u origin main 
(once you have set the upstream) just do git push

git remote set-url origin git@github.com:Akshay-ST/Spark-Notebooks.git
ssh -vT git@github.com

======================================
pushing updates to repo (itv):-

eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add ast
git add *
git commit  -m ''
git push origin master

==========================================
Sir's Notes
==========================================

git clone <url>

git status

git add .

git commit -m "message"

git push origin main

---

git remote add origin <url.git>

git remote -v

git branch (tell us on which branch we are)

local branch = master, remote branch = main
we need both to be same, so we change 

git branch -M main

git push origin main
git push -u origin main (sets the upstream)

then subsequntly, we can just

git push

---
git branch (to check which branch)
git branch -M main (to rename a branch name)
git branch feature1 (to create a new branch)
git checkout feature1 (to switch to feature1 branch)
git checkout -b feature2 (to create and navigate to a new branch)
git checkout -b feature3 feature2 (it will take the base as feature2)
git branch -d feature3

1st scenario - you made changes which are not even staged
git restore <filename>

2nd scenario - you made changes and have staged those changes
git restore --staged <filename>
git restore <filename>

3rd scenario - you made changes and have committed those changes
git log (shows the commit history, the most recent commit will be at the top)
git reset head~1

git log
git reset bf914703674450b1e2ed5f0208afcea8bdb501b7
git reset --hard bf914703674450b1e2ed5f0208afcea8bdb501b7
